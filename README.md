# aoc2023

its like typescript or elixir or something, but its python so its different

anywho, advent 2023, in python, thanks to hatch i guess for the spinup at least

does shiny new python stuff, requires at least 3.10

### why is this code so.............. ?

i try not to use libraries or fancy things in aoc.
- does that mean i rarely get past day 12? yes
- does that mean the code i produce is horrifying in eldritch ways? yes
- does that mean i create inventive and terrifying ways to parse and deal w/ the data? yes
- is it funner this way? heck if I know
